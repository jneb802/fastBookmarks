# Privacy Policy for Fast Bookmarks

**Last Updated:** November 2, 2025

## Overview

Fast Bookmarks is a browser extension that provides quick keyboard access to your bookmarks. Your privacy is important to us.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your data.**

## Data Usage

Fast Bookmarks:
- Reads your bookmarks locally to display them in the overlay menu
- Only accesses the current tab when you press the Alt+K keyboard shortcut
- Does not track your browsing history
- Does not collect analytics or usage data
- Does not store any information outside of your browser
- Does not communicate with external servers

## Permissions Explained

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **bookmarks**: To read and display your saved bookmarks
- **activeTab**: To show the bookmark overlay on your current tab when you activate the shortcut
- **scripting**: To inject the overlay interface into the active tab

All processing happens locally in your browser. No data ever leaves your device.

## Third-Party Services

Fast Bookmarks does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

The extension displays website favicons using Google's favicon service (`https://www.google.com/s2/favicons`) to show icons next to bookmark titles. This only happens when you open the overlay and only for bookmarks you choose to display.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in this document with an updated "Last Updated" date.
